# PCMWithSeff's

Currently, there are two vesions available. The "Old Version" is dated to 13Jul 2017 and only has a few Seff's implemented. It's use is to ahve a version for a "diff tool" as this version is validated. The other vesion in the folder "PCMWithSeff's" has a plain Seff for each Method due to analysis reason (An analysis requires a seff for each method, even if it is plain). 

As we want to analyse the model as soon as the Seffs are completed, we use this version.

Important:   
Meta-Model Version 5.2 is used. If your PalladioDrop does not show any models, you might need to update your eclipse/palladiodrop-version.

Still not done yet:

1. Implement Seffs
2. Add Event Parameter
3. repair model concerning "Validation Errors"
