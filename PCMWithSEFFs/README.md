# PCMWithSeff's

Currently, there are 3 versions available. The "Old Version" is dated to 13Jul 2017 and only has a few Seff's implemented. It's use is to have a version for a "diff tool" as this version is validated. The other vesion in the folder "PCMWithSeff's" has a plain Seff for each Method due to analysis reason (An analysis requires a seff for each method, even if it is empty). 
The third version is a fully Palladio4 compatible version from July 7th.

As we want to analyse the model as soon as the Seffs are completed, we use the second version.

Important:   
Meta-Model Version 5.2 is used. If your PalladioDrop does not show any models, you might need to update your eclipse/palladiodrop-version.

Still not done yet:

1. Implement Seffs
2. Add Event Parameter DONE!
3. repair model concerning "Validation Errors" DONE!

##Compability
- For now, we are using the [nigthly build of Palladio](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/palladiobench/binary_nightly/). This has to be improved, as nightly builds can contain bugs.
- Therefore, we provide a [Palladio4 compatible version](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/palladiobench/releases/4.0.0/), which is not always up to date
