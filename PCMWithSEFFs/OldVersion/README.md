# PCMWithSeff's

Currently, there are two vesions available. The "Old Version" is dated to 13Jul 2017 and only has a few Seff's implemented. It's use is to ahve a version for a "diff tool" as this version is validated. The other vesion in the folder "PCMWithSeff's" has a plain Seff for each Method due to analysis reason (An analysis requires a seff for each method, even if it is plain). 

As we want to analyse the model as soon as the Seffs are completed, we use this version.

Still not done yet:

1. Implement Seffs
2. Add Event Parameter
3. repair model concerning "Validation Errors"
