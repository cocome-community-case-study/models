# CoCoME PCM Model With Seff's

Currently, there are 3 versions available. 

###Old Version
The "Old Version" is dated to 13Jul 2017 and only has a few Seff's implemented. It's use is to have a version for a "diff tool" as this version is validated. This version needs Palladio 4.1

###Palladio 4.0 Compatible Version
This is a fully Palladio4 compatible version from Semptember 27th, 2017. This version is not always up to date, as the conversion from 4.1 to 4.0 has to get executed manually. We will continuously care about its topicality.

###Current Version - Palladio 4.1
This is the version we work on. It has at least a plain Seff for each Method due to analysis reason (An analysis requires a seff for each method, even if it is empty). So far, we put the sale procedure to practise. So each Seff/method which is involved into the sale procedure (start sale, select product, select payment method, pay) got implemented.




##Important:   
Meta-Model Version 5.2 is used. If your PalladioDrop does not show any models, you might need to update your eclipse/palladiodrop-version to [Palladio 4.1](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/PCM_4.1)
