# Differences in CoCoME-Cloud and Tech-Report

- Figure 5.9 Architecture Overview of the Hybrid Cloud-based Variant of CoCoME
- Figure 5.2 First Part fo the Sequence Diagram of the Proces Sale UseCase

- CDEIventBus from 5.2,5.9 is missing in model (cocome-cloud)
- Model contains ICashBoxLocal but no ICashBox like 5.2,5.9 and vis versa
- ICashDeskEventHandler does not exist in model
- The fully qualified names of components do not match
- Not all interfaces are labeled correctly in 5.2,5.9
- Model contains which are not depicted in 5.9 and 5.2
  - org.cocome.tradingsystem.cashdeskline.cashdesk.CashBoxEventHandler 
  - org.cocome.tradingsystem.cashdeskline.cashdesk.ExpressLightEventHandler
  - org.cocome.tradingsystem.cashdeskline.cashdesk.PrinterEventHandler
  - org.cocome.tradingsystem.cashdeskline.cashdesk.UserDisplayEventHandler
  - 
- Multiple components named CashDesk in 5.9
- There is a component org.cloud.web.usecase in the model, but in 5.9 it is called WebFrontend::UseCases, it should be named WebFrontend in both cases
- Model ICashDeskModelLocal -> 5.9 ICashDeskModel

- Diagram 5.2 depicts
  - the sequence over services borders. This is not a good idea. It also discusses implementation details, like message busses.
  - a method fire with a property SaleStartedEvent, but there is no fire method in the model. There are fireSaleRegisteredEvent (<SourceRole>).
  - a fire(SaleStartedEvent), but the model only contains a source role fileSaleRegisteredEvent, are they the same?

Furthermore, the images in 5.9 do not match the system model. The system model only includes the pickup shop?
