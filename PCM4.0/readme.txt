Original Notes of CoCoME PCM
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Modelling:
- Introduced a facade component for
	- TradingSystem.Inventory.Data
	- TradingSystem.Inventory.Application
to support business logic for composite structures

Assembly Connectors at requires side of ProductDispatcher are missing

Short comings
- Had to add Facade components
- Left out POS-Part of CoCoME
- Distribution: 1:n relations between StoreServer and EnterpriseServer has to be modelled
explicitly
- Simplified allocation: 3 on 3: inventory, data, gui
- Inventory CC allocated - not system

Signatures:
- used int instead of long for all ids in signatures
- All non-primitive and non-collection data types are modeled as CompositeDataTypes
- made TYPE[] data types collection data types with inner composite data type of type TYPE
- Exceptions are not modelled because of a lack of support by analysis tools

SEFFs finished:
- org.cocome.tradingsystem.inventory.application.store:
	- bookSale(SaleTO saleTO)
- org.cocome.tradingsystem.inventory.data.store.impl.StoreQueryImpl
	- queryStockItemById(long stockId, PersistenceContext pctx)
	- queryLowStockItemsWithRespectToIncomingProducts(long storeId, PersistenceContext pctx)
	- QueryStockItem
- org.cocome.tradingsystem.inventory.data.persistence.impl.PersistenceImpl
	- getPersistenceContext()
- org.cocome.tradingsystem.inventory.application.productdispatcher.impl.ProductDispatcher
	- orderProductsAvailableAtOtherStores(
			EnterpriseTO enterpriseTO, StoreTO callingStore,
			Collection<ProductAmountTO> productAmounts)

SEFF modeling problems:
- only first call is a interface call. TransactionContext is returned --> NOT a pure data type.
		PersistenceContext pctx = persistmanager.getPersistenceContext();
		TransactionContext tx = null;

		try {
			tx = pctx.getTransactionContext();
			tx.beginTransaction();
- Concurrency for parallel databaseFlush() is not supported. A loop is modelled instead with
one iteration for each concurrent thread.

Notes of CoCoME PCM Extension for SLA@SOI
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- deleted old project files
- deleted JDBC required interfaces from data and system component
- deleted Interfaces "JDBC" and "Bank"
- deleted Resource Container "StoreServerProcessorShare"
- deleted Composite Component "TradingSystem.CashDeskLine"
- deleted Resource Container "CashDeskPC"
- deleted Linking Resource "CashDeskPC - StoreServer"
- deleted external SEFF diagrams
- deleted internal SEFF diagrams in "cocome.repository_diagram"

Refined deployment structure:
- defined scenario with 1 EnterpriseServer, 2 StoreServers, each server with 1 client
- deleted Application.Facade and Data.Facade components
- deleted Application, Data and GUI composite components
- deployed basic components directly on resource containers of new scenario

Making simulation work:
- had to delete 1 of 2 System Provided Roles for Interface "CashDeskConnectorIf"
  (simulation can only cope with 1 System Provided Role for each Interface)

Remaining ToDos:
- verify simulation results
- model SEFFS and Data Types appropriately
- model Services on top of the TradingSystem
