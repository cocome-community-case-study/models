# CoCoME UML Model
This is a CoCoME UML model as it is extracted by [Codeling](https://s3gitlab.paluno.uni-due.de/ADVERT/codeling) from a [slightly adapted version](https://s3gitlab.paluno.uni-due.de/ADVERT/case-study_cocome-plain-java) of the [Plain Java CoCoME implementation](https://github.com/cocome-community-case-study/cocome-plain-java).

It is used as the basis for an evolution scenario within the SPP, in which a new payment provider is added with a more abstract interface than `IBank`.

The repository contains the original (pre change) model.
